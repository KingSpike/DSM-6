# DSM-6
A personal attempt at changing the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, hopefully garnering some change.

## part 1 : the Introduction

  This text is intended to be a model for these so called Illnesses and Disorders, describing how they behave together and how they develop together.\
  
The brain is a highly complex chemical computing system. in previous years we did not think that we could have stack overflow errors occuring in ones mind but it happens and if left uncheck may be irrevirsible even with chemical intervention.

  It is the view of many that the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria is flacid and weak, with the goal being to create clear cut categories. this should have never been the goal if they were true data scientists; dare I say it, true scientists at all. 
  
  This is not possible; for every expression of the brain that we percieve is infact a specrum reaction. When we refer to the brain it is a singular organ with many functions, this is something we have to maintain, there are quadrants in the brain that have different electrochemical patterns they have to process that information into something we can use.
  
  Chaos is a concept in mathematics, it states that there is no such thing as randomness or irregularity; instead the system just has highly sensitive initial conditions that if altered slightly would creat catastrophic changes to the system at large. The brain is one of those systems. A perspective completely ignored by the American Pychological Association.
